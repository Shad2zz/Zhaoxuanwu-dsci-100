    "## Background\n",
    "- Video‐game research platforms (e.g., Minecraft servers) enable computer science researchers to collect real‐world player behavior data.  \n",
    "- The UBC research group led by Frank Wood aims to leverage these data to optimize player recruitment and allocate server resources effectively.  \n",
    "- Subscribing to the game newsletter serves as an indicator of player engagement and future interaction intent.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question\n",
    "> “Can player demographics (age, gender, experience) and behavioral features (total play time, number of sessions, average session duration, night/weekend play proportion) predict whether a player will subscribe to the game newsletter?”\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Description\n",

    "  - **Observations:** 196  \n",
    "  - **Variables (6):  \n",
    "    - `hashedEmail` (string): unique player identifier  \n",
    "    - `experience` (numeric): cumulative experience points  \n",
    "    - `played_hours` (numeric): total play time (hours)  \n",
    "    - `subscribed` (factor): subscription status (“Yes”/“No”)  \n",
    "    - `gender` (factor): gender (“Male”/“Female”/“Other”)  \n",
    "    - `age` (numeric): age in years  \n",
    "  - **Data Quality:** some missing age values; subscription rate approx. 60% Yes, 40% No\n",

    "    - `end_time` (string datetime): session end time (UTC)  \n",
    "  - **Data Quality:** some sessions span midnight, requiring careful handling in feature engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Potential Issues:**  \n",
    "> - Time zone alignment and timestamp consistency  \n",
    "> - Players with no sessions or extremely long/short sessions  \n",
    "> - Unobserved external factors (e.g., network outages, server maintenance) may influence behavior  \n",
